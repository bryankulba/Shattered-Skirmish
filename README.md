# SHATTERED

SHATTERED is a Mordheim-first narrative skirmish game set during the Horus Heresy.

It focuses on isolated groups of Space Marines operating after catastrophic engagements — cut off from command, low on ammunition, and fighting without reinforcement.

This repository contains the canonical ruleset.

## Design Structure

SHATTERED separates structure from statistics:

- **Mordheim governs structure and sequencing.**
- **Age of Darkness governs statlines and weapon profiles unless explicitly overridden.**

The following Age of Darkness systems do not apply unless explicitly referenced:

- Reactions  
- Challenges  
- Keywords  

Models act independently.  
There are no units.  
There is no wound pooling.
