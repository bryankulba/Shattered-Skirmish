# Advancement

Advancement represents battlefield adaptation and accumulated experience.

Advancement is resolved during Step 8 of the Post-Battle Sequence.

All models track Experience Points (XP) individually.

Warbands are not units and never gain shared advancements.

---

## Experience Points (XP)

Models gain XP from the following sources:

- Survive the battle — +1 XP  
- Take an enemy Out of Action — +1 XP  
- Scenario contribution — +1 XP (maximum once per battle)  
- Warband controls the field — Veteran Sergeant gains +1 XP  

A model may gain a maximum of +3 XP per battle.

XP is recorded immediately.

---

## Advancement Roll

When a model reaches an advancement threshold:

- Roll 3D6.
- Apply the result from the Advancement Table.

If the result cannot be applied, re-roll.

Results of 3, 12, or 18 instead generate a roll on the Characteristic Table (1D6).

Each model may only gain each characteristic increase once ever.

# Advancement Table (3D6)

| 3D6 | Result |
|------|--------|
| 4 | **Relentless Advance** — May move and fire non-assault weapons without penalty. |
| 5 | **Close-Quarters Killer** — Re-roll one failed To Wound roll in melee per battle. |
| 6 | **Steady Under Fire** — Ignore the first failed Ammo roll each battle. |
| 7 | **Oath of Moment** — Nominate one enemy model at the start of the battle. Re-roll one failed To Hit roll per round against that model. |
| 8 | **Grim Determination** — May ignore being Knocked Down once per battle. |
| 9 | **Brutal Charge** — +1 Strength in the first round of a charge. |
| 10 | **Heart of the Legion** — If this model did not move in its activation this round, it gains +1 FP when firing. |
| 11 | **Precision Fire** — Model does not need to target the closest model when firing. |
| 13 | **Battlefield Calculus** — Once per battle, after both sides have rolled for activation priority, you may re-roll your result. |
| 14 | **Fearless Aspect** — Causes Fear. |
| 15 | **Executioner** — If this model takes an enemy Out of Action in melee, gain +1 XP (maximum once per battle). |
| 16 | **Battlefield Predator** — +1 Attack in the first round of combat. |
| 17 | **Iron Resolve** — Once per battle, this model may ignore the effects of being Stunned. Treat the result as Knocked Down instead. |

# Characteristic Table (1D6)

Roll 1D6 on a result of 3, 12, or 18 on the Advancement Roll.

Each characteristic may only be increased once per model.

| 1D6 | Result |

| 1 | +1 Weapon Skill |
| 2 | +1 Ballistic Skill |
| 3 | +1 Initiative |
| 4 | +1 Leadership |
| 5 | +1 Attack |
| 6 | +1 Wound |

If a rolled characteristic has already been increased for this model, re-roll.
