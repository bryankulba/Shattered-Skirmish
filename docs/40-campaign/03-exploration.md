# Exploration

Exploration represents post-battle reconnaissance and recovery.

Exploration is resolved during Step 6 of the Post-Battle Sequence.

Exploration follows a Mordheim-style duplicate system.

---

## Exploration Dice

Roll Exploration dice as follows:

- Roll 1D6 for each surviving Hero.
- Roll +1D6 if the warband controlled the field.

Models taken Out of Action do not generate Exploration dice.

If more than three dice are rolled, retain only the three highest dice for all purposes.

---

## Resolving Exploration

After rolling:

1. Retain up to three highest dice.
2. Check the retained dice for duplicates.
3. If any duplicates are present, resolve the Duplicate Table.
4. If all retained dice are unique, resolve the Total Table.

Duplicate results override the Total Table.

If more than one duplicate set exists, resolve each set separately.

A result of three 1s or three 6s is resolved as a triple, not as a total of 3 or 18.

---

# Total Table (All Unique Dice)

Add the three retained dice.

Possible totals: 6–15.

| 8 | **Recovered Ammunition** — Gain 1D3 RP. |
| 9 | **Battlefield Debris** — Gain 1 Salvage and 1 RP. |
