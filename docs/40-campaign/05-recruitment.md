# Recruitment

Recruitment restores losses within a warband.

Recruitment does not increase maximum composition limits.

Recruitment is resolved during Step 7 of the Post-Battle Sequence.

---

## Recruitment Opportunities

A Recruitment Opportunity is generated if:

- Any retained Exploration die shows a natural 6.

Only one Recruitment Opportunity may be gained per Post-Battle Sequence.

A Recruitment Opportunity:

- Expires at the end of the current Post-Battle Sequence.
- Requires an open warband slot.
- Does not stack.

If no open slot exists, the opportunity is lost.

---

## Cost

To recruit:

- Select an eligible model type with an open slot.
- Pay the full RP cost of that model as listed in Warband Creation.
- Consume the Recruitment Opportunity.

If sufficient RP is not available, the opportunity expires.

---

## Recruitment Procedure

After paying the model’s full RP cost:

1. Add the model to the roster.
2. Roll 2D6 on the Recruitment Table.
3. Apply the result immediately.
4. Roll on the Allegiance Table (Draft).
5. Record all effects.

Recruits:

- Begin with 0 XP unless otherwise stated.
- Must follow all Warband Creation equipment restrictions.
- May not exceed composition limits.

Recruitment never bypasses:

- Model caps
- Equipment restrictions
- Upgrade limitations

# Recruitment Table (2D6)

| 2D6 | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2 | **Deranged Survivor** — The recruit is unstable. Gains +1 Attack in the first round of combat in each battle. At the start of each battle, roll 1D6: on a 1, the model must move toward the nearest visible enemy in its first activation if able. |
| 3 | **Armour Scarred** — Begins with *Armour Compromised*. |
| 4 | **Weaponless Arrival** — Begins with *No Weaponry*. Must be re-equipped using Salvage. |
| 5 | **Shaken Survivor** — –1 Leadership next battle only. |
| 6 | **Line Legionary** — No additional effects. |
| 7 | **Recovered Brother** — No additional effects. |
| 8 | **Disciplined Fighter** — Gain +1 XP immediately. |
| 9 | **Proven Under Fire** — Gain +1 XP. |
| 10 | **Recovered Wargear** — Gain 1 Salvage. |
| 11 | **Veteran of Attrition** — Gain +2 XP. |

# Allegiance & Cohesion (Draft)

Status: Draft

After resolving the Recruitment Table, roll 2D6 on the Allegiance Table.

This represents fractured loyalties, inter-Legion mistrust, and the instability of shattered forces.

Apply the result immediately.

---

## Allegiance Table (2D6)

| 2D6 | Result |
|------|--------|
| 2 | **Open Hostility** — The recruit begins with –1 Leadership permanently. The warband must re-roll its first successful Rout test each battle while this model is operational. |
| 3 | **Distrusted** — The recruit may not benefit from Leadership re-rolls from the Veteran Sergeant. |
| 4 | **Tense Alliance** — No mechanical effect. Narrative only. |
| 5 | **Uneasy Cohesion** — –1 Leadership in the first battle only. |
| 6 | **Conditional Loyalty** — No additional effect. |
| 7 | **Accepted into the Line** — No additional effect. |
| 8 | **Earned Respect** — Gain +1 XP immediately. |
| 9 | **Trusted Brother** — While operational, the warband may re-roll one failed Rout test per campaign. |
| 10 | **Shared Oath** — The recruit and one Hero both gain +1 XP. |
| 11 | **Battle-Bound** — While within 6" of the Veteran Sergeant, the recruit gains +1 Leadership. |
| 12 | **Oath-Sworn to the Shattered** — The recruit ignores the first failed Rout test they would suffer each battle. |

---

## Restrictions

Allegiance results:

- Do not alter composition limits.
- Do not grant equipment.
- Do not override core Leadership rules unless explicitly stated.

All effects are recorded immediately.
