# Salvage & Requisition

Salvage and Requisition Points (RP) represent the material condition of a warband.

Both are generated during the Post-Battle Sequence.

Neither may be generated or spent outside that sequence unless explicitly stated.

---

## Requisition Points (RP)

Requisition Points represent manpower, munitions, and logistical support.

RP is used to:

- Recruit new models
- Replace casualties
- Pay upgrade costs
- Pay Recruitment Opportunity costs

RP gained during Step 4 (Resource Conversion) may not be spent during the same Post-Battle Sequence.

RP gained during Exploration may be spent during Step 7 (Recruitment), unless explicitly restricted.

Unspent RP is retained between battles.

RP is never refunded when a model is removed from the roster unless explicitly stated.

---

## Resource Caches

Resource Caches are the primary guaranteed source of RP and Salvage.

For each Secured Resource Cache:

- Roll 1D3 and gain that many RP.
- Gain 1 Salvage.

Unsecured caches are lost.

Resource Caches never grant models or equipment directly.

---

## Salvage

Salvage represents recoverable materiel: armour plating, munitions, machine components, and battlefield remnants.

Salvage may only be spent during Step 5: Repair & Refit.

Unspent Salvage is retained between battles.

Salvage may never:

- Improve characteristics
- Purchase weapons
- Recruit models
- Override composition limits

---

## Spending Salvage

Salvage may be spent only during Step 5 of the Post-Battle Sequence.

Permitted uses:

- **Repair Armour Compromised** — 2 Salvage
- **Repair Damaged Weapon** — 1 Salvage
- **Re-equip Weaponless Recruit** — 1 Salvage
- **Stabilise Injury** — 1 Salvage  
  - Re-roll one non-permanent Injury result  
  - Must accept the second result

All repairs take effect immediately.

Salvage may not be spent after Recruitment or Advancement steps begin.

---

## Restrictions

Salvage and RP:

- Do not stack beyond recorded totals.
- Do not grant scaling benefits.
- Do not activate unit-based mechanics.

All gains and expenditures must be recorded immediately on the warband roster.
