# Campaign Overview

SHATTERED is designed for persistent campaign play.

Warbands accumulate injuries, salvage, experience, and reinforcements over multiple battles.

All post-battle resolution follows a mandatory sequence.

---

## Scope

This section governs all between-battle procedures, including:

- Post-Battle Sequence
- Injury Resolution
- Resource Caches
- Salvage
- Exploration
- Reinforcements
- Experience and Advancement

These rules are resolved immediately after each battle.

---

## Structural Authority

- Consequence precedes recovery.
- Recovery precedes opportunity.
- Opportunity precedes growth.

The Post-Battle Sequence must be followed in order unless a scenario explicitly overrides it.

No campaign resource may be generated, spent, or resolved outside the Post-Battle Sequence unless explicitly stated.

---

## Campaign Principles

- Attrition is persistent.
- Recovery is limited.
- Reinforcement restores continuity, not strength.
- Warbands do not scale through unit unlock mechanics.

All effects are recorded on the warband roster immediately.
