# Post-Battle Sequence

Resolve the following steps in order after each battle.

This order is mandatory unless a scenario explicitly states otherwise.

---

## 1. Determine Battle Outcome

- Resolve scenario objectives.
- Determine which warband controlled the field, if applicable.
- A warband that Routed is considered to have lost.
- Apply any scenario-specific post-battle effects.

---

## 2. Injury Resolution

- Roll on the appropriate Injury Table for every model taken Out of Action.
- Apply all permanent and temporary injuries immediately.
- Remove models that are killed or rendered unfit for service.

This step defines the warband’s true post-battle state.

---

## 3. Secure Resource Caches

- Determine which Resource Caches were secured.
- Caches carried by surviving or withdrawing models are Secured.
- Unsecured caches are lost.
- Record the number of Secured Caches.

---

## 4. Resource Conversion

For each Secured Resource Cache:

- Roll 1D3 and gain that many Requisition Points (RP).
- Gain 1 Salvage.

RP gained during this step may not be spent during this sequence.

Record all totals on the warband roster.

---

## 5. Repair & Refit

- Spend Salvage to repair armour, weapons, or stabilise injuries.
- Apply all effects immediately.
- Salvage not spent is retained.

Salvage may only be spent during this step.

---

## 6. Exploration

- Roll Exploration dice as defined in the Exploration section.
- Resolve all Exploration results.

If one or more Exploration dice show a 6, the warband may gain one Recruitment Opportunity, if eligible.

---

## 7. Recruitment

If a Recruitment Opportunity is available, the warband may:

- Spend 5 RP and roll on the New Recruit Table, or
- Decline the opportunity.

Unused Recruitment Opportunities expire at the end of this sequence.

---

## 8. Experience & Advancement

- Award Experience Points (XP).
- Resolve advancements, if any.

Advancement follows the Mordheim Advance Roll system unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 9. Update Roster

- Record all injuries, repairs, RP totals, Salvage totals, XP gains, advancements, and roster changes.
- Prepare the warband for the next battle.
