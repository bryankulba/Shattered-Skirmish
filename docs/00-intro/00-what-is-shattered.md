# What Is SHATTERED?

**SHATTERED** is a small-scale narrative skirmish game set during the Horus Heresy.

It focuses on isolated groups of Space Marines operating after catastrophic engagements — cut off from command structures, low on ammunition, and fighting without reinforcement.

This is not a simulation of Legion warfare.

It is a game about fractured units, hard commitments, and irreversible consequences.

## Relationship to Horus Heresy: Age of Darkness

SHATTERED is designed for players familiar with **Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness**.

It preserves:

- Space Marine statlines  
- Weapon profiles  
- Core shooting mechanics  
- Melee characteristics  
- The underlying combat math  

Age of Darkness rulebooks remain useful references for:

- Profiles  
- Wargear  
- Weapon characteristics  

SHATTERED changes the structure of play — not the martial language of the setting.

The goal is to create an easy transition for Horus Heresy players, while shifting the focus from army-scale engagements to small, independent warbands.

## Design Lineage

Structurally, SHATTERED is inspired by Mordheim.

It adopts:

- Independent model activation  
- Persistent injuries  
- Warband-level morale and rout tests  
- Post-battle exploration  
- Resource scarcity  

Where Age of Darkness provides battlefield language and statistics, Mordheim provides sequencing and consequence.

## Scale of Play

A typical warband consists of:

- 5–7 models  
- Individually activated  
- With persistent injuries and equipment  

Engagements are played on dense, vertical terrain.

Positioning matters.  
Commitment matters.  
Disengagement is dangerous.

---

## Core Experience

SHATTERED prioritizes:

- Commitment over flexibility  
- Risk over optimization  
- Fictional coherence over symmetry  
- Clarity over layered mechanics  

Combat is decisive.  
Mistakes have consequences.  
Campaign progression is uncertain.

Models will be injured.  
Weapons will fail.  
Warbands will rout.

---

## What This Game Is Not

SHATTERED is not:

- Age of Darkness at reduced points  
- A competitive tournament format  
- A reaction-driven tactical system  
- A layered stratagem engine  

It is a skirmish system built for narrative campaign play within the Age of Darkness setting.
