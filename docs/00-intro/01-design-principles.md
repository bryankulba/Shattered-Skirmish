# Design Principles

SHATTERED is governed by a defined set of structural priorities.

When mechanical decisions are unclear, these principles take precedence.

---

## 1. Structural Hierarchy

SHATTERED separates **structure** from **statistics**.

- **Structure and sequencing** are inspired by Mordheim.
- **Statistics, profiles, and weapon characteristics** are preserved from Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness unless explicitly overridden.

Age of Darkness statlines, weapon profiles, and core combat math remain intact by default.

Changes to statlines or weapon profiles are a last resort and only implemented when required to preserve clarity at the skirmish scale.

When structural conflict occurs:

- **Mordheim structure governs resolution.**
- **Age of Darkness statistics remain intact unless explicitly modified.**

### Explicit Structural Exclusions

The following Age of Darkness systems do not apply:

- **No Reactions.**
- **No Challenges.**
- **Keywords do not apply unless explicitly referenced within SHATTERED.**

These exclusions prevent procedural layering and maintain clarity at the model level.

---

## 2. Commitment Over Flexibility

Actions carry risk.

- Charging commits a model.
- Breaking from combat is dangerous.
- Running prevents shooting.
- Positioning errors are punishable.

Models should not act without consequence.

---

## 3. Risk Over Optimization

The game rewards informed decisions — not list efficiency.

- Combat is lethal.
- Ammunition is scarce.
- Weapons may misfire.
- Injuries persist between battles.

Mechanics should not exist solely to smooth variance or eliminate risk.

---

## 4. Fictional Coherence Over Symmetry

Balance is desirable.  
Symmetry is not mandatory.

If a rule improves narrative plausibility at the cost of mechanical neatness, plausibility prevails.

---

## 5. Clarity Over Layered Status Effects

Rules resolve cleanly.

Avoid:

- Stacking conditional modifiers
- Nested reaction chains
- Temporary layered statuses

If a mechanic requires multiple tracking tokens to function, it should be reconsidered.

---

## 6. Independent Action

Models act individually.

- Each activation matters.
- Each model’s survival matters.
- Warband morale reflects cumulative loss.

Unit-level abstraction is intentionally avoided.

---

## 7. Persistence Matters

Campaign play is central.

- Injuries remain.
- Equipment must be replaced.
- Resource Caches generate long-term advantage slowly.
- Reinforcements are uncertain.

Progression should feel earned, not guaranteed.

---

## 8. Verticality Is Tactical

Terrain influences decisions.

- Height offers advantage.
- Falling is dangerous.
- Diving charges are meaningful.
- Movement is positional.

Boards should reward planning and punish careless exposure.

---

## 9. Brutality With Restraint

Combat resolves quickly.

A fight should not require multiple procedural layers to conclude.

When possible:

- Roll.
- Resolve.
- Continue play.

---

## Design Authority

SHATTERED is not a consensus-driven document.

Playtest feedback may inform changes.

The canonical rulebook repository defines the active ruleset.
