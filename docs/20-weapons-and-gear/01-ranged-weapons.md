# Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons in SHATTERED use the profiles printed in:

Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness (3rd Edition Liber books)

Unless explicitly overridden in SHATTERED, use the weapon’s:

- Range
- Strength
- AP
- Type
- Firepower (FP)
- Special rules

All shooting resolution follows the procedures defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`

---

## 1. Weapon Types

Weapon Types (e.g., Assault, Heavy, Rapid Fire) are interpreted using Age of Darkness definitions, except where explicitly modified by SHATTERED.

### 1.1 Assault Weapons

Assault weapons may be fired even if the model moved during its activation.

They are not subject to the –1 to hit penalty for moving.

All other shooting modifiers still apply.

---

## 2. Ammunition Scarcity (Standard Weapons)

At the start of each battle, roll **1D6 per ranged weapon** to determine ammunition availability.

This roll applies only for the duration of that battle.

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | Unstable Supply — Any unmodified hit roll of 1 triggers a Weapon Misfire roll |
| 2–5 | The weapon may fire that many times during the battle |
| 6 | Unlimited shots for the battle |

- Weapons with Firepower (FP) greater than 2 still count as a single shot.
- Bolt Pistols are not subject to ammunition scarcity.

Once a weapon has expended its available shots, it may not be fired again during that battle.

---

## 3. Weapon Misfire

When required to roll for Weapon Misfire, resolve the result using the Mordheim Blackpowder Weapon Misfire table.

This table is reproduced in:

`docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`

The Misfire table is used identically and without modification.

---

## 4. Special Weapons

Special weapons use their printed Age of Darkness profiles, with modified ammunition rules.

At the start of each battle, roll **1D3 per Special Weapon** to determine ammunition availability:

| D3 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | The weapon may fire once during the battle |
| 2 | The weapon may fire twice during the battle |
| 3 | The weapon may fire three times during the battle |

Special weapons:

- May never have unlimited shots.
- Always roll on the Weapon Misfire table on any unmodified hit roll of 1.

This applies regardless of ammunition remaining.

Once a Special Weapon has expended its available shots, it may not be fired again during that battle.

---

## 5. Multiple Wounds

If a ranged weapon causes multiple wounds:

- Resolve damage normally.
- When rolling on the Injury Table, apply **+1 to the Injury roll**.

This modifier is applied after armour saves are resolved.

---

## 6. Targeting

All targeting is resolved at the model level.

- There is no wound pooling.
- There are no units.
- Each shot targets a specific model.

Closest target restrictions and shooting modifiers are defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`

---

## 7. Exclusions

The following Age of Darkness systems do not apply:

- Reactions
- Challenges
- Keyword-based interactions (unless explicitly referenced in SHATTERED)

---

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13 — Initial draft
- 2026-02-13 — Adjusted Special Weapon scarcity to D3 (never unlimited; always misfires on 1)
