# Armour

Armour in SHATTERED uses the profiles printed in:

Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness (3rd Edition Liber books)

Unless explicitly overridden in SHATTERED, use the model’s printed Armour Save.

---

## 1. Armour Saves

When a model suffers a wound:

1. Roll to hit.
2. Roll to wound.
3. Apply Armour Save.
4. If the save fails, roll on the Injury Table.

Armour saves are modified by the attacking weapon’s AP characteristic as printed in Age of Darkness.

---

## 2. Critical Hits

Critical hits:

- Bypass Armour Saves entirely.

If a hit is a Critical Hit, do not roll an Armour Save.

Resolve the Injury roll directly.

Critical resolution is defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/04-melee.md`

---

## 3. Multiple Wounds

If a weapon causes multiple wounds:

- Resolve armour saves normally.
- If the wound proceeds to Injury resolution, apply **+1 to the Injury roll**.

---

## 4. Armour Degradation

Armour may become degraded through campaign injuries.

For example:

- Armour Compromised: –1 to Armour Save until repaired.

Repair procedures are defined in:

`docs/30-campaign/`

Armour degradation never modifies a model’s base profile permanently unless explicitly stated.

---

## 5. No Additional Defensive Layers

The following Age of Darkness defensive systems do not apply unless explicitly referenced elsewhere in SHATTERED:

- Reactions
- Challenge-based defensive effects
- Keyword-based defensive modifiers

Invulnerable saves or special defensive rules apply only if explicitly retained within SHATTERED.

---

## 6. Model-Level Resolution

All armour saves are resolved at the model level.

- There is no wound pooling.
- Each model rolls its own saves.
- Casualties are applied individually.
