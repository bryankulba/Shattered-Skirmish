# Melee Weapons

Melee weapons in SHATTERED use the profiles printed in:

Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness (3rd Edition Liber books)

Unless explicitly overridden in SHATTERED, use the weapon’s:

- Strength modifiers
- AP
- Special rules
- Wound characteristics

Close combat resolution follows the procedure defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/04-melee.md`

---

## 1. Weapon Profiles

All melee weapons use their printed Age of Darkness characteristics.

Special rules printed on a weapon apply unless:

- They rely on Reactions,
- They rely on Challenges,
- They rely on Keywords not explicitly referenced in SHATTERED.

In such cases, ignore those elements.

---

## 2. Parry

The following grant Parry:

- Swords
- Combat Shields

A model may only use **one Parry per combat opponent**.

If a model is engaged with multiple enemies, it may Parry once against each opponent.

Parry follows Mordheim conventions:

- The highest successful enemy hit may be forced to re-roll.

Parry does not stack against a single opponent.

---

## 3. Multiple Wounds

If a melee weapon causes multiple wounds:

- Resolve damage normally.
- When rolling on the Injury Table, apply **+1 to the Injury roll**.

This modifier is applied after armour saves are resolved.

---

## 4. Critical Hits

Critical hits in melee:

- Bypass armour saves.

Critical resolution follows the procedure defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/04-melee.md`

---

## 5. Engaged Combat

All melee combat is resolved at the model level.

- There are no units.
- There is no wound pooling.
- A model engaged with multiple enemies may choose which engaged enemy to direct its attacks against.

Charging, initiative order, and combat sequencing are defined in:

`docs/10-core-rules/04-melee.md`

---

## 6. Exclusions

The following Age of Darkness systems do not apply:

- Challenges
- Reactions
- Keyword-based conditional effects (unless explicitly referenced in SHATTERED)
