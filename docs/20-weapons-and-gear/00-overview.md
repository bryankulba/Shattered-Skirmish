# Weapons & Gear Overview

SHATTERED uses **Warhammer: Horus Heresy – Age of Darkness** as the primary reference for:

- Weapon profiles
- Armour profiles
- Wargear profiles

Unless explicitly overridden in SHATTERED, use the profile as printed.

This section describes how weapons and gear are interpreted and used within SHATTERED’s Mordheim-first structure.

---

## Scope

This section covers:

- How to read and apply AoD weapon and armour profiles in SHATTERED
- Restrictions and exclusions (e.g., Keywords not applying unless referenced)
- Shared mechanical interpretations used across Shooting and Melee

Detailed in-battle procedures are defined in Core Rules:

- Shooting procedure: `docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`
- Melee procedure: `docs/10-core-rules/04-melee.md`

Campaign access to equipment (what you can obtain, when, and how) is defined elsewhere.

---

## Rules Authority

- **Mordheim governs structure and sequencing.**
- **Age of Darkness governs weapon and gear statistics unless explicitly overridden.**

The following AoD systems do **not** apply unless explicitly referenced in SHATTERED:

- Reactions
- Challenges
- Keywords (unless explicitly referenced in SHATTERED)

All actions, targeting, and injury resolution occur at the **model level**.

---

## Firepower (FP)

Weapons with a Firepower (FP) characteristic greater than 2 still count as a **single shot** for SHATTERED ammunition tracking purposes.

---

## Ammunition Scarcity Reference

Ammunition scarcity is resolved in the Shooting rules:

- See `docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`

Bolt Pistols are explicitly exempt from ammunition scarcity.

---

## Special Weapons Instability Reference

Special weapon instability (unmodified hit rolls of 1 triggering misfire) is resolved in the Shooting rules:

- See `docs/10-core-rules/03-shooting.md`
