# Melee

The Close Combat Phase resolves all fighting between Engaged models.

Combat follows Mordheim structure and sequencing.

There are no Challenges.
There are no Reactions.

---

## 1. Engagement

A model is **Engaged** when it is in base contact with one or more enemy models.

- A model is engaged with all enemy models it is in base contact with.
- A model may choose which engaged enemy to direct its attacks against.
- Facing is ignored.

---

## 2. Charging

To Charge:

- The model declares a Charge.
- The model moves up to **Movement + D6"**.
- The model must attempt to reach base contact with the declared target.

If the model cannot reach base contact, the Charge fails and the model stops at the furthest legal point along its path.

A model that successfully Charges:

- Counts as charging.
- Strikes before non-charging opponents in the first round of combat.

All models that successfully charge the same enemy count as charging and gain charging benefits.

A model may not Charge if it began its activation Engaged.

---

## 3. Combat Sequence

Resolve each combat in the following order:

1. Determine strike order (charging models strike first).
2. Roll To Hit (Weapon Skill vs Weapon Skill).
3. Roll To Wound.
4. Resolve Armour Saves.
5. Roll on the Injury table for each unsaved wound.

Each model resolves its attacks individually.

There is no wound pooling.

---

## 4. Critical Hits

Critical hits bypass armour saves.

Other effects of critical hits follow Mordheim conventions unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 5. Injury Resolution (In-Game)

When a model suffers an unsaved wound, roll **1D6**:

- **1–2:** Knocked Down  
- **3–4:** Stunned  
- **5–6:** Out of Action  

All lasting injury effects are resolved after the battle in the Campaign Rules.

---

## 6. Multiple Wounds

Multi-wound models:

- Ignore the first Out of Action result.
- Instead lose one Wound.
- If reduced to 0 Wounds, further Out of Action results apply normally.

Weapons that cause multiple wounds apply **+1** to the Injury roll.

---

## 7. Breaking from Combat

A model may break from combat if:

- It panics, or
- A rule requires it to flee.

When a model breaks from combat:

- It immediately moves away as required.
- The opposing model gains an automatic hit against the fleeing model.

There is no separate Break Test mechanic beyond Rout Tests.
