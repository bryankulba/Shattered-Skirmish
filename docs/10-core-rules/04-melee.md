# Melee

The Close Combat Phase resolves all fighting between Engaged models.

Combat follows Mordheim structure and sequencing.

There are no Challenges.  
There are no Reactions.

---

## 1. Engagement

A model is **Engaged** when it is in base contact with one or more enemy models.

- A model is engaged with all enemy models it is in base contact with.
- A model may choose which engaged enemy to direct its attacks against.
- Facing is ignored.

---

## 2. Charging

To Charge:

- The model declares a Charge.
- The model moves up to **Movement + Initiative"**.
- The model must attempt to reach base contact with the declared target.

If the model cannot reach base contact, the Charge fails and the model stops at the furthest legal point along its path.

A model that successfully Charges:

- Counts as charging.
- Strikes before non-charging opponents in the first round of combat.

All models that successfully charge the same enemy count as charging and gain charging benefits.

A model may not Charge if it began its activation Engaged.

---

### Boarding Shield – Shield Bash

A model equipped with a **Boarding Shield** may attempt a **Shield Bash** when declaring a Charge.

If, during a successful Charge, the charging model would reach base contact with more than 2" of charge distance remaining, it may declare a Shield Bash before resolving combat.

The Shield Bash is resolved immediately upon reaching base contact.

#### Shield Bash Procedure

1. Both players roll 1D6.
2. Compare results.

##### If the Charging Model Wins

The charging model may push the target model directly away up to 2".

- The pushed model must move in a straight line directly away from the charger.
- If this movement forces the model off a ledge or elevated surface, the model immediately falls.
  - Resolve falling distance and injury as normal.
- If no fall occurs, the target model is Knocked Down.

The charging model then moves into base contact as normal.

The charge counts as successful and the charger retains charging benefits.

##### If the Charging Model Loses or Ties

The Shield Bash fails.

- The charging model does not gain charging strike priority.
- The defender strikes first in the first round of combat.
- The charge otherwise proceeds normally.

#### Restrictions

- Shield Bash may only be attempted once per Charge.
- Shield Bash may not be used if the charging model began its activation Engaged.
- Shield Bash does not replace normal attacks.
- This rule only applies to models equipped with a Boarding Shield.

## 3. Combat Sequence

Resolve each combat in the following order:

1. Determine strike order (charging models strike first).
2. Roll To Hit (Weapon Skill vs Weapon Skill).
3. Roll To Wound.
4. Resolve Armour Saves.
5. Roll on the Injury table for each unsaved wound.

Each model resolves its attacks individually.

There is no wound pooling.

---

## 4. Critical Hits

Critical hits bypass armour saves.

Other effects of critical hits follow Mordheim conventions unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 5. Injury Resolution (In-Game)

When a model suffers an unsaved wound, roll **1D6**:

- **1–2:** Knocked Down  
- **3–4:** Stunned  
- **5–6:** Out of Action  

All lasting injury effects are resolved after the battle in the Campaign Rules.

---

## 6. Multiple Wounds

Multi-wound models:

- Ignore the first Out of Action result.
- Instead lose one Wound.
- If reduced to 0 Wounds, further Out of Action results apply normally.

Weapons that cause multiple wounds apply **+1** to the Injury roll.

---

## 7. Breaking from Combat

A model may break from combat if:

- It panics, or
- A rule requires it to flee.

When a model breaks from combat:

- It immediately moves away as required.
- The opposing model gains an automatic hit against the fleeing model.

There is no separate Break Test mechanic beyond Rout Tests.
