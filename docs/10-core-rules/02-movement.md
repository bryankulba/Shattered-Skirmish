# Movement

Movement determines how models reposition across the battlefield.

All distances are measured in inches.

A model must complete its movement before performing any other action during its activation.

Vertical movement, climbing, jumping, and falling are defined in:

> 06-terrain-verticality.md

---

## 1. Normal Move

During its activation, a model may move up to its **Movement (M)** characteristic.

- Movement may be taken in any direction.
- A model may pivot freely during movement.
- A model may not move through other models.
- A model may not move through impassable terrain.
- A model must end its move in a legal position.

---

## 2. Run

A model may choose to Run instead of making a Normal Move.

- A Running model may move up to **Movement + Initiative (M + I)**.
- A model that Runs may not shoot during the same activation.
- A model that is Engaged at the start of its activation may not Run.
- Running does not allow a model to enter base contact with an enemy unless declaring a Charge (see Melee).

Running represents committed forward movement at speed.

---

## 3. Engaged Models

A model is **Engaged** when it is in base contact with an enemy model.

An Engaged model:

- May not make a Normal Move.
- May not Run.
- Must resolve combat during its activation as defined in:

> 04-melee.md

Leaving engagement is resolved under the Melee rules.

---

## 4. Movement Restrictions

Movement must follow these constraints:

- A model may not end its movement overlapping another model.
- A model may not pass through enemy models.
- Friendly models may not be moved through unless physically permitted by terrain and base sizes.
- A model must be able to physically occupy the position it ends its movement in.

If a model cannot legally reach its declared position, the movement ends at the furthest legal point along its path.

---

## 5. Measuring Movement

Movement is measured from the edge of a model’s base to its new position.

Pre-measuring is permitted.

All measurements must be declared clearly before repositioning the model.
