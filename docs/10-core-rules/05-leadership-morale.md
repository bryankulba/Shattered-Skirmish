# Leadership & Morale

Leadership in SHATTERED represents battlefield discipline, cohesion under pressure, and the ability of a warband to continue fighting in isolation.

Morale follows Mordheim conventions unless explicitly overridden.

There are no additional AoD status effects such as Pinning, Fear, or Reactions unless explicitly introduced elsewhere.

---

## 1. Rout Threshold

A warband must begin testing for Rout when **25% or more** of its models are Out of Action.

The threshold is calculated based on the number of models in the warband at the start of the battle.

Models removed from play as casualties count toward this threshold.

---

## 2. Rout Tests

At the end of its turn, a warband that has reached the Rout threshold must take a Rout Test.

- Roll **2D6**.
- If the result exceeds the Leader’s Leadership characteristic, the warband fails the test.
- If failed, the battle ends immediately.
- If passed, the warband continues fighting.

Rout Tests are taken once per turn while the threshold condition remains true.

---

## 3. Voluntary Withdrawal

If a warband has lost **25% or more** of its models, it may voluntarily withdraw at the start of its Rout Phase.

- Voluntary withdrawal ends the battle immediately.
- No additional penalty is applied beyond the outcome of the battle itself.

## 4. Breaking from Combat

Breaking from combat is not a separate morale test.

Breaking is resolved under:

> 04-melee.md

There is no additional Break Test mechanic beyond the Rout system.

---

## 5. Zero Operational Models

If a warband is reduced to zero Operational models, the battle ends immediately.
