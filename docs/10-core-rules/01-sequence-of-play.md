# Sequence of Play

A battle of SHATTERED follows a defined structure.

All in-battle procedures must follow this order unless explicitly modified by a mission.

Pre-game setup (terrain, Resource Caches, deployment, and first turn determination) is resolved before the first turn begins, as defined in the Core Rules.

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn follows the Mordheim sequence:

1. Recovery Phase  
2. Movement Phase  
3. Shooting Phase  
4. Close Combat Phase  
5. Rout Phase  

Players alternate activating their warband at a time during each phase.

- There are no reactions.
- There are no interrupt mechanics.
- An activated warband completes all permitted actions before control passes to the opponent.
- All effects resolve immediately unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 1. Recovery Phase

Resolve all effects that occur at the start of the turn.

- Stunned models become **Knocked Down**.
- Knocked Down models remain Knocked Down until they stand during their Movement Phase.
- Any rule that specifies it resolves at the start of a turn is resolved here.

---

## 2. Movement Phase

Models may:

- Move
- Run
- Charge
- Jump
- Stand Up

Movement rules and restrictions are defined in:

> 02-movement.md

---

## 3. Shooting Phase

Models that are eligible to shoot may resolve ranged attacks.

Eligibility, modifiers, ammunition rules, and misfires are defined in:

> 03-shooting.md

---

## 4. Close Combat Phase

Resolve all combats involving engaged models.

Combat sequence, charging bonuses, critical hits, and injury resolution are defined in:

> 04-melee.md

---

## 5. Rout Phase

At the end of the turn, check whether a warband must test for Rout.

- If 25% or more of the warband is Out of Action, it must take a Rout Test.
- If the test is failed, the battle ends immediately.

Rout and voluntary withdrawal are defined in:

> 05-leadership-morale.md

---

## Ending the Battle

A battle ends when:

- A warband fails a Rout Test.
- A warband voluntarily withdraws.
- A warband is reduced to zero Operational models.
- A mission objective declares the battle over.

Post-battle procedures are resolved in the Campaign Rules.
