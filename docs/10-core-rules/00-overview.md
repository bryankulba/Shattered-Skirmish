# Core Rules Overview

This section defines how a battle of SHATTERED is played.

Core Rules govern all in-battle procedures, including:

- Battlefield preparation
- Deployment
- Model activation
- Movement
- Shooting
- Melee combat
- Morale and Rout tests
- Vertical interaction

Campaign systems such as injuries, exploration, salvage, and reinforcements are handled separately.

---

## Design Hierarchy

SHATTERED is a **Mordheim-first** system.

- Mordheim governs structure, sequencing, and resolution order.
- Age of Darkness governs statlines, weapon profiles, and equipment characteristics unless explicitly overridden.
- Where conflict exists, Mordheim conventions take precedence.

---

## Activation Model

SHATTERED uses independent, alternating model activation.

- Players alternate activating one model at a time.
- An activated model completes its movement and actions before control passes.
- There are no interrupt mechanics.
- All effects resolve immediately unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- There are no units and no coherency requirements.

All targeting and damage resolution occur at the model level. There is no wound pooling.

---

## Modifiers

Modifiers stack unless explicitly stated otherwise.

The following shooting modifiers are established:

- –1 to hit if a model moved and fires a non-Assault weapon.
- –1 to hit if the target is beyond half the weapon’s maximum range.

## Structure of a Battle

A standard game proceeds as follows:

1. Prepare the battlefield.
2. Deploy warbands.
3. Resolve turns using the Mordheim sequence of play.
4. Test for Rout when required.
5. End the battle when one warband withdraws or is eliminated.

Each turn follows the Mordheim sequence:

1. Recovery Phase
2. Movement Phase
3. Shooting Phase
4. Close Combat Phase
5. Rout Phase

Each phase is defined in detail in the sections that follow.

## Rules Authority

Core Rules govern all in-battle resolution.

- Mission rules override Core Rules only where explicitly stated.
- Campaign mechanics do not alter combat procedures unless explicitly defined.
- If a rule is not modified by a mission or campaign mechanic, the Core Rules apply as written.
