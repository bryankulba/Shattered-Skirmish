# Terrain & Verticality

SHATTERED is designed for dense, multi-level battlefields.

Vertical positioning, elevation advantage, and hazardous movement are central to gameplay.

Terrain interaction follows Mordheim conventions unless explicitly overridden.

---

## 1. Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain reduces movement.

- Moving through difficult terrain costs double movement.
- A model may not Run through difficult terrain unless physically possible within its movement allowance.
- Charges through difficult terrain must still legally reach base contact.

---

## 2. Climbing

Models may climb vertical surfaces where physically possible.

- A model may attempt to climb up to its full Movement characteristic.
- Climbing requires an **Initiative test**.
- If the test is failed, the model falls (see Falling).

A model must be able to physically stand in the destination position.

---

## 3. Jumping

A model may leap across horizontal gaps.

- A model may Jump up to a distance equal to its **Initiative (I)** in inches.
- Jumping requires an Initiative test.
- If the test is failed, the model falls.

Jumping is resolved during the Movement Phase.

---

## 4. Falling

If a model falls:

- Measure the distance fallen.
- The model suffers a hit following Mordheim falling rules.
- Armour saves are taken as normal.
- If the model survives, it is placed Prone (Knocked Down).

Falling may occur as a result of:

- Failed climbing.
- Failed jumping.
- Being forced off a ledge.
- Any rule that causes displacement from elevation.

---

## 5. Death from Above

Death from Above follows the Mordheim **Diving Charge** rules.

A model charging from a higher elevation may attempt a Diving Charge.

- The model must declare a Charge.
- The model must have sufficient movement to reach the target.
- The model must pass an Initiative test.

If successful:

- The charging model gains +1 to hit in the first round of combat.

If failed:

- The model falls and suffers falling effects.

Death from Above represents a committed, high-risk vertical assault.

---

## 6. Elevation and Line of Sight

Line of sight is determined physically.

Models positioned at higher elevation:

- May see over lower obstacles where physically appropriate.
- Do not gain automatic defensive bonuses unless provided by terrain.

There are no abstract elevation modifiers beyond those defined above.
