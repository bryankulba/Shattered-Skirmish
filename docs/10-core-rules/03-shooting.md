# Shooting

The Shooting Phase resolves all ranged attacks made by eligible models.

All shooting is resolved at the model level.

There is no wound pooling and no unit-based targeting.

---

## 1. Eligibility to Shoot

A model may shoot if:

- It did not Run this activation.
- It did not Charge this activation.
- It is not Engaged in close combat.

Assault weapons may always fire unless explicitly prohibited by another rule.

---

## 2. Targeting

- A model must target the closest visible enemy model where applicable.
- Line of sight must be physically traceable from the firing model to the target.
- Cover and visibility modifiers follow Mordheim conventions.

All attacks are resolved against a single target model.

---

## 3. Shooting Modifiers

The following modifiers apply:

- –1 to hit if the firing model moved and is using a non-Assault weapon.
- –1 to hit if the target is beyond half of the weapon’s maximum range.

Modifiers stack unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 4. Resolving a Shot

To resolve a ranged attack:

1. Declare target.
2. Roll To Hit (BS vs required value).
3. Roll To Wound.
4. Resolve Armour Saves.
5. If an unsaved wound is caused, roll on the Injury table.

Critical hits bypass armour saves.

Injury resolution is defined in:

> 04-melee.md (Injury Resolution section)

---

## 5. Ammunition & Scarcity

At the start of the battle, roll **1D6 per ranged weapon** to determine ammunition availability.

The result applies for the duration of that battle only.

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | **Unstable Supply** – Any unmodified hit roll of 1 triggers a Weapon Misfire roll. |
| 2–5 | The weapon may fire that many times during the battle. |
| 6 | Unlimited shots for the battle. |

Weapons with a Firepower (FP) characteristic greater than 2 still count as a single shot.

Bolt Pistols are **not** subject to ammunition scarcity.

---

## 6. Special Weapons – Risk of Catastrophic Failure

All special weapons are unstable.

Any unmodified hit roll of 1 made with a special weapon immediately triggers a roll on the Weapon Misfire Table, regardless of ammunition availability.

This effect is in addition to any misfire triggered by an Unstable Supply result.

---

## 7. Weapon Misfire Table

When a weapon suffers a misfire, roll **1D6**:

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | **BOOM!** The weapon explodes. The shooter suffers an S4 hit (no critical hit possible). The weapon is destroyed. |
| 2 | **Jammed.** The weapon is jammed and useless for the remainder of the battle. |
| 3 | **Phut.** The weapon fails to fire. The shooter must wait one extra turn before firing this weapon again. |
| 4–5 | **Click.** The weapon fails to fire with no additional effect. |
| 6 | **KA-BOOM!** The shot hits the intended target and counts as having +1 Strength. |

Destroyed weapons may not be used again during the battle.

Persistent damage effects are resolved in the Campaign Rules.
