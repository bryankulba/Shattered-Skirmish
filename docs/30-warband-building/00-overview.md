# Warband Overview

A warband represents a fragmented Astartes force operating in isolation.

Warbands are constructed using **Requisition Points (RP)** and consist of individual models, not units.

This section defines how warbands are assembled, structured, equipped, and maintained between games.

---

## Scope

This section covers:

- Starting Requisition values
- Composition limits
- Heroes and Henchmen structure
- Model costs
- Baseline equipment
- Upgrade permissions and restrictions
- Equipment exclusions
- Roster requirements

Detailed in-battle procedures are defined in Core Rules.

Campaign advancement, injuries, and post-battle management are defined in Campaign sections.

---

## Structural Authority

- Warbands are not units.
- No model benefits from unit-based scaling rules.
- The Age of Darkness rule “For every five models in the unit…” does not apply in SHATTERED.
- All rules operate at the individual model level.

---

## Heroes and Henchmen

Warbands are divided into:

- **Heroes**
- **Henchmen**

Heroes generate advancement and campaign progression benefits as defined in Campaign rules.

Henchmen operate as individual models and do not form units.

---

## Requisition Points (RP)

Requisition represents manpower, materiel, and logistical support available to an isolated force.

RP is used to:

- Recruit models
- Replace casualties
- Purchase permitted upgrades

Starting RP values are defined in the Warband Creation section.
